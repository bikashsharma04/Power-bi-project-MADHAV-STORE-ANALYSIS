# Power-bi-project-MADHAV-STORE-ANALYSIS
MADHAV STORE. The owner of the Madhav Store has requested our help in creating a dashboard that can track and analyze their online sales across India. In other words, they want to be able to monitor and evaluate their online sales performance in different regions of India.

I am attaching the power bi file and also the raw csv. files.
